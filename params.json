{"name":"Hifito","tagline":"Hidden File Toggle","body":"# Hifito\r\n\r\nHifito is a small utility for Windows, that allows to quickly toggle the \"Show hidden files\" and \"Hide extensions for known file types\" Explorer settings. Both settings can be changed using a global, system-wide hotkey or through the tray menu. The utility is written in C using only the Windows API, so it's really fast and lightweight.\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n\r\n* [Download installer](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0tbj7us5j6h4vul/hifito-setup.exe?dl=0)\r\n* [Download binary](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hqtcp92ir3zohme/Hifito.exe?dl=0)\r\n* [Download portable binary](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1ma6oigxhdnsdzu/Hifito-portable.exe?dl=0)\r\n\r\n## The latest version\r\n\r\nDetails of the latest version can always be found on Hifito's project page on sourceforge.org at http://sourceforge.net/projects/hifito/.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nHifito can run on Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 (and probably Windows 8).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nThere is an automatic installer available for Hifito.
