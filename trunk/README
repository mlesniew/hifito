What is it?
-----------

Hifito is a small utility for Windows, that allows to quickly toggle the "Show hidden files" and "Hide extensions for known file types" Explorer settings. Both settings can be changed using a global, system-wide hotkey or through the tray menu. The utility is written in C using only the Windows API, so it's really fast and lightweight.


The latest version
------------------

Details of the latest version can always be found on Hifito's project page on sourceforge.org at http://sourceforge.net/projects/hifito/.


Requirements
------------

Hifito can run on Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 (and probably Windows 8).


Installation

There is an automatic installer available for Hifito. Manual installation is also possible and very simple. As the program is a single native Windows executable, you can download it (Hifito.exe), put it anywhere on your disk and start it from there.
